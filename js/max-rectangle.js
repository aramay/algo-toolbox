/**
 * Max rectangle in binary matrix
 * 
 * Given a binary matrix, find the maximum size rectangle binary-sub-matrix with all 1â€™s and return it's area.
 * 
 * 
 * A = [
 *    [1,1,1],
 *    [o,1,1],
 *    [1,0,0]
 *    ]
 * 
 * Output = 4
 * 
 * as the max area rectangle is created by 2x2 
 * => (0,1),(0,2),(1,1) and (1,2)
 * 
 * Bonus: O(n^2)
