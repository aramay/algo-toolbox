/**
 * 
One Edit Distance
Given two words, determine if the the first word is one edit away from the second word.


One edit on a word can be one of the following:
Add a character
Remove a character
Change the character 

Input: Two Strings
Output: Boolean
Example
Input: ‘table’, ‘tablet’   =>	Output: true (edits: 1)
Input: ‘table’, ‘tale’	=>	Output: true (edits: 1)
Input: ‘table’, ‘cables’	=>	Output: false (edits: 2)
Constraints
Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(1)

If the two inputs strings are the same, return false
Assume only lowercase letters, no spaces
