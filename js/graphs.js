  *  Prompt: Create a Vertex class/constructor and Graph class/constructor.

  *               value: integer value (initially null)                            
  *               edges: hash that contains edges to other vertices

  *                                                                                
  *            vertices: A hash/dictionary/object to store vertices                
  *       totalVertices: The total number of vertices in your Graph                
  *          totalEdges: The total number of edges in your Graph                   
  *

  *                                                                                
  *           addVertex: Method that accepts an id (int/str), and creates an       
  *                      object with a "value" of id, and a property called        
  *                      "edges" which will store the edges of the vertex. If a    
  *                      vertex with the id already exists, then do not create a   
  *                      new vertex.

  *           getVertex: Method that takes an id, and outputs the vertex with the  
  *                      matching id, if it exists.

  *             addEdge: Method that accepts two different id's as its input, and  
  *                      creates an edge between both vertices.                    
  *                      (This edge may look like [id1,id2])                       
  *                                                                                
  *          removeEdge: Method that accepts two different id's as its input, and  
  *                      removes the edge between the two vertices if it exists.   
  *                                                                                
  *        removeVertex: Method that takes an id as its input, and removes the     
  *                      vertex with the matching id.                              
  *                                                                                
  *       findNeighbors: Method that accepts an id as its input, and returns       
  *                      all of the edges of that vertex.                          
  *                                                                                
  *       forEachVertex: Method that accepts an operation, and performs that       
  *                      operation on each vertex in the Graph.                    
  *                                                                                
  *  Input:  N/A                                                                   
  *  Output: A Graph instance                                                      
  *                                                                                
  *  What are the time and auxilliary space complexities of the various methods?
